                <p style="text-align:justify">
                  The end result of this project is aimed at solving the problem of predicting when a frequency spectrum is not in use.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">
                  Cognitive radio or software defined radio enables its users to dynamically access any available channel through spectrum decision, spectrum sharing and spectrum mobility. The four major functions that are performed are spectrum sensing, spectrum decision,
                  spectrum sharing and spectrum mobility. To reduce the delay that occurs between when the spectrum becomes free and when it is acquired by the secondary user, we predict when next it will be free and when it will not. This prediction
                  also helps us by asking the secondary user to stop transmitting at a frequency if it is expected to be used by the primary user.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">
                  We propose a two tiered model that has a central predictor and a local predictor to accomplish the aforementioned task. The central predictor surveys various frequency spectra at various times and various regions by looking at the power spectral density
                  value there whereas the local predictor is implemented at the secondary user itself and this is based only on the immediate past PSD values. The approach used at the central predictor is to look for patterns that occur in the transmissions.
                  The first approach that didn’t yield favorable results involved processing the PSD values in the frequency domain using Fourier Analysis. The second approach was in the time domain by using a combination of encoding theory and the autocorrelation
                  function. The local predictor was implemented using regression.

                <h2> AI-solver </h2>
                <p style="text-align:justify">
                  The intuition to ai-solver is as follows: For each game state, one of the 4 possible directions can be the next
                  move. Each of these next moves results in a different game state. Now, a random position is generated and can be
                  anywhere in the '0' cells of the new game state. Theoretically, if enough computation power is available, all the
                  game states can be traversed and the game can be solved. This is an exponential solution and time taken is huge.
                  This method can be made better using back-propogation and depth-first-search. This is again a exponential solution.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Many game states can be intelligently removed using a simple heuristic. The corner positions of the matrix have
                  maximum weights and the other cells weights decreases slowly. An example weight assignment would be
                  {{3,2,1,0},{2,1,0,-1},{1,0,-1,-2},{0,-1,-2,-3}}. similarly the weight assignment with bottom-right as the highest
                  values is -(top-left). So basically we have two different weight assignments.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  The solver basically tries to minimize the worst possible loss. that is based on minimax decision rule, it tries to
                  avoid the worst case scenario. the minimax rule and the expectiminimax tree are actually fromulated for 2-player
                  ZERO-SUM game, this strategy can be extended to 2048 game. it searches the space and creates a tree until it reaches
                  a possible predefined depth.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3> how AI is used to solve 2048</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Identification of two players(analogous to the zero-sum game): first is the ai solver which plays teh game and the
                  second is the computer which assigns a random position with values 2 or 4. Now the frist player-aisolver tries to
                  maximize the score (which is calculated based on the heuristic described above). according to the zero-sum game,
                  the second player 'computer' should try to minimize its loss.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  The sover implemented here uses the expectiminimax algorithm. its a variation of the minimax algo, but the outcome
                  depends upon the expected value of the random event occuring. here the random event is the new position of the 2 or
                  4 occuring after each move. depth is taken as 3. more than 3 is making the program to run very slowly. another
                  assumption that we are taking here is that the random value generated is always '2'. In the actual game, the probablity
                  of a '2' appearing is 0.9 and prob of '4' occuring is 0.1. the ai is implemented in such a way as to consider these cases
                  also.

                <h2>Drawing undirected graphs using Spring Model</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Graphs(networks) are very common data structures which are handled in computers. Diagrams are
                  widely used to represent the graph structures visually in many information systems. In order to
                  automatically draw the diagrams which are, for example, state graphs,data-flow graphs,Petrinets, and
                  entity-relationship diagrams,basic graph drawing algorithms are required.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  The Kamada-Kawai model suggests an algorithm for drawing general undirected graphs. Each graph is seen as
                  follows- a virtual dynamic system in which every two vertices re connected by a 'spring'. Then the optimal
                  layout of veritces is regarded as the state in which the total spring energy of the system is minimal.

                  In this project, this paper was carefully studied and was tested by implementing the algorithm given in C++.
                  OpenGL was used to add graphics and display the input graph and required output.

                <h2>A Classroom Environment</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  A classroom environment was created with the help of simple cubes, cuboids and quads. OpenGL transformations was
                  used to create parts of objects such as table, chair, benches, etc. Everything in the render was solid coloured and
                  textures was not used.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Mostly the structure quad (in particular Cubes) were used to make all the objects in the environment. The following
                  objects can be found in the scenario - walls, tables, benches, a book, black board, rotating fans, ceiling, floor
                  with tiles (with chequered pattern) and blackboard. A projector will also be included. Animation has been added to
                  make the fans rotating.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  The fans are again created by manipulating the DrawTableLeg() function with scaling parameters and translating it to
                  different co-ordinates. Animataion has been added to make the fans spin about its own axis, at different speeds.
                  This is a simple hack involving-translate the fan to origin of world coordinates, use glRotatef() function to rotate
                  the fan to a different angle about its axis and translate the fan back to a different position. Each time the fan
                  is rotated, the glutPostRedisplay() function is called to repaint the window, this gives an illusion of the fan
                  rotating.

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                  Antenna is an indispensible component in wireless communication, which is so ubiquitous that we cannot think
                  of our modern life without this. A lot of work has been done on antennae in the radio frequency (RF) range.
                  With ever-increasing demand for reducing space, increasing speed and reducing power requirements, the technology
                  has taken a leap from microscale to nanoscale thereby giving rise to nanotechnology. The advent of nanotechnology
                  thereby reducing size and increasing speed of the electronic devices has compelled the antennae to scale down to
                  nanoscale to gain compatibility with the developing technology.

                  This NEC technology may also support several emerging applications, including passive energy management
                  products, such as building insulation, window coatings, and heat dissipation in small electronic consumer
                  products, such as, computers. The nantennas are broadband collectors of energy with a tailorable spectral
                  emission response.
